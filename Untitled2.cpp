/*Imagine a tollbooth at a bridge. Cars passing by the booth are expected to pay a 100/-
 toll. Mostly they do, but sometimes a car goes by without paying. The tollbooth keeps
 track of the number of cars that have gone by, and of the total amount of money collected.
  Model this tollbooth with a class called tollBooth. The two data items are a type
  int to hold the total number of cars, and a type double to hold the total amount
 of money collected. A constructor initializes both of these to 0. A member function called
 payingCar() increments the car total and adds 100/- to the cash total. Another function,
 called nopayCar(), increments the car total but adds nothing to the cash total. Finally, a
 member function called display() displays the two totals. Make appropriate member
 functions const.*/
